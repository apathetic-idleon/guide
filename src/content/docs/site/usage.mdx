**We're an unofficial fan-made guide.**  

The project is maintained by [Apathetic Tools](https://github.com/apathetic-tools) and contributions from the community.  

*Not affiliated in any way with <a href={affilGameUrl} class="text-inherit">{affilGame}</a> &copy; <a href={affilDevUrl} class="text-inherit">{affilDev}</a>.*  
<small>*Images and content from the game are used for commentary, instruction, and informational purposes only.*</small>


## For the player

You're free to master IdleOn with the help of the *Apathetic Guide to IdleOn*.  
We made this for you.


## For content creators

You can use the guide while you play, stream, or record!  

Your content should focus on **you playing the game**, not just reading from the guide.

- ✅ Use the guide while you play IdleOn on stream or in a video series.  
- ❌ Don’t create tutorials that just copy the guide word-for-word. <br /><small>*That would be commercial use on almost any platform.*</small>


## Content License

The guide content is dual-licensed under <a href={licenseUrl}>{license}</a>, with **additional “No AI” terms** (see below).  

**Summary of the license:**
- You must **credit us**. Please link back to this site.  
- You may **not** use the content for commercial purposes.  
- You must license your **entire work** under the same terms (share-alike). 

If you need a more permissive license,  
<a href={"mailto:"+orgEmail+"?subject=Idleon Guide Content License"}>talk to us about your project</a>.


### What counts as commercial purposes?

Our interpretation of **"commercial use"** includes (but isn’t limited to) any content that:

- Is considered commercial in your jurisdiction.  
- Involves **donations** (Twitch Bits, PayPal, Ko-fi, etc.).  
- Involves **subscriptions** (Patreon, Twitch subs, YouTube membership).  
- Contains **ads or sponsorships** (even if placed by the platform, around or after your content).  
- Contains **self-promotion of other commercial projects**.  


### Can I copy into my own doc or sheet?

Yes, as long as you follow the Content License rules.  

When you distribute your copy or give access to others, Share-Alike means:
- You must provide a copy that is **publicly viewable in its original form**, so others can inspect and duplicate it.  
- Restricted-access copies or disabling copying is **not allowed**.  

You can still publish your content (e.g., via Google Docs or Sheets), but you must:
- Include a link to the **raw document**, and  
- Ensure anyone can freely access and make a copy of it.


## Additional Terms — No AI Use Rider

- You may **not** include this content in any dataset intended for AI/ML training.  
- You may **not** provide access to this content for AI/ML training purposes.

## FAQ

### Why non-commercial?

As noted above in our [commercial use section](#what-counts-as-commercial-purposes), “commercial use” includes, but is not limited to, donations, subscriptions, ads, sponsorships, and other revenue-generating activities.  

Essentially, **any activity that could generate money for you or others counts as commercial use**.  

We don’t want others to profit from the guide — whether through ad-supported wikis or creators using the guide as a paid script.  

The **CC BY-NC-SA** license ensures the guide remains a free and open resource for everyone.


### Why share-alike?

We chose **CC BY-NC-SA** (instead of CC BY-NC) for content and **AGPLv3** (instead of MIT) for code so that:

- If *Apathetic Tools* ever stops hosting the guide, fans can continue it elsewhere.  
- If those fans eventually stop hosting, their improvements can still be shared.  
- Every generation of contributors must **share alike** to help the guide survive over time.

This ensures continuity, collaboration, and long-term accessibility for the community.


### Why No AI on content?

We are **not opposed to AI in principle**, but we do **opt out of AI training** for now.  

Until we are satisfied that we can ensure:

- Proper **attribution** for content creators,  
- Communities can **contribute back** to the guide, and  
- Revenue sharing for creators exists,  

the content of this guide may **not be used to train or improve AI systems**.  

This restriction applies to both commercial and non-commercial use.
