## FAQ

### Why non-commercial?

We don't want our guide used as a script for someone else to make money. 

We don't want a commercial (wiki) company to copy and paste it then slap ads on it.

We don't want our efforts used by someone else to start or bolster their own business.

### Why Share-Alike?

We specifically and carefully chose the `CC-SA` variant (*instead of just `CC-BY-NC`*) and the `Affero GNU license` (*instead of `MIT`*).

It's because we want the guide to have a chance to exist long after we're gone.

> If one day we're no longer around to keep the guide relevant in a timely maner, we want our fans to be able to continue the guide elsewhere.

But what if those fans, after improving the guide for awhile, in turn, go away?

> We want them to make the same pledge to their fans. 

That they will give all their improvements and updates to their fans to do the same.

> We want them to *share alike*. So that the guide can live on.

### Why No AI on content?

As human beings, we're not opposed to AI specifically. However this guide and project is, as much as we can, opting out from becoming part of AI, AI Chatbots, and AI Search engines. In these early days we are concerned how the traditional website ecosystem will correctly function in an AI workflow. 

* Attribution; How will the AI attribute our contributors, if at all?
* Community; How will the AI direct users to contribute to the guide so it becomes more accurate in the future? 
* Financial Support; Since most AI are commercial and will be generating revenue from their users, how will those companies share revenue with content creators so that we can continue to support creating and maintaining the guides?

Until these are answered to our satisfaction, as much as we can, we will opt out of AI Chatbots operated by others.
