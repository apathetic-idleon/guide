## How you can help

Weâ€™re always looking for ways to improve the guide. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s most useful right now:

- Writing new guides for topics not currently covered.  
- Expanding or clarifying existing sections.  
- Gathering verified data to support guide advice (e.g., realistic progress for new accounts).  

Anyone can help! Even small observations are valuable.


#### Translations

Not currently accepting translations. We want a solid English guide first. Once thatâ€™s complete, we may explore multilingual versions.

## FAQ

### Where do I start?

The best way to help is by expanding guides, clarifying instructions, or collecting verified data. You can share contributions via <a href={discordInvite}>Discord</a> or <a href={source}>GitHub</a>.

### Are you accepting translations?

Not yet. English is the primary focus for now. Once the guide is solid, translations may be considered.

### Why do contributions require a separate license?

The guide content is dual-licensed to allow open community use while also giving us the flexibility to offer alternative licensing if needed.  

A contributor license ensures we have the right to do that.  

This allows the guide to be maintained, contributors to be properly recognized, and infrastructure or community initiatives to be supported in the future.

### Do you own my contributions?

No. You retain full ownership. We only receive a license to use and relicense your contributions for the project. You may freely use your contributions elsewhere.

### Who has contributed so far?

Check our <a href="/site/credits/">credits page</a> for a list of contributors.
