**We're an unofficial fan-made guide.**

We're always looking for help with the guide. 

## What we'd like help with

At this time, we are primarily looking for help with the following:

- Creating new guides for topics not currently covered.
- Expanding guide sections.
- Improvements on existing sections.
- Gathering data to back up advice.<br /><small>We are especially interested in progress new accounts realistically make in small time frames.<br />Anyone can help with that.</small>

Come talk to us!

#### Are you accepting translations?

Not at this time. We want to ensure we have a solid guide in English first, then think about the best way to proceed with translations.

## Where to offer help

You can come talk to us on <a href={discordInvite}>Discord</a>, or help tackle an issue on <a href={source}>GitHub</a>.

## Contribution License

All contributions to the project from users; that is any diff, additions, changes, deletions, information, or contributions; be they on Discord, Github, or elsewhere; are considered licensed from you to the project in the following way:

- Your code contributions to the project are licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
- Your content contributions; text, animations, images, videos, or other assets; to the project are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Internaltion](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) license.      

We do not accept any contributions under any other licenses. This will provide you with attribution.

It will also allow us the posibility to accept monetary support in the future to keep the guide online and compensate people for their time.

## FAQ

### Where do I get started helping?

The best improvements come with expanding the guides themselves. Improvements on existing sections. Gathering data to back up decision making. Come talk to us!

### Where can I send my input?

You can come talk to us on <a href={discordInvite}>Discord</a>, or file an issue on <a href={source}>GitHub</a>.

### Are you accepting translations?

Not at this time. We want to ensure we have a solid guide in English first, then think about the best way to proceed with translations.

### Who has contributed so far?

See <a href="/site/credits/">our credits</a> page.

### Why do you require a different license for contributions?

Our non-custom default project content license <a href={licenseUrl}>{license}</a> does not allow commercial use, and our code license of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 3.0</a> does not allow us to create custom licenses for special use cases.

We feel strongly that someday in the future we would like to be able to compensate people for their time, pay for infrastructure costs, and create community incentives to grow. 

This is what allows that option.

### Do you own my contributions?

No.

This is not a traditional Contributer License Agreement (CLA) nor is it assigning copyright for your contribution to us. It gives the project a commercial and relicense-friendly non-revocable license to your contributions for us to add to the project, for which you receive attribution. Your contribution are still owned by you, and you can turn around and do with them as you please elsewhere.
