## Similarities to other sources

### IdleOn Assets

All <a href={affilGameUrl}>IdleOn - The Idle RPG</a> game assets, images, videos are Copyright &copy; <a href={affilDevUrl}>LavaFlame2</a>, all rights reserved.

They are only reproduced, hosted, or used within this website and codebase with the express intent to provide (usually opinionated) instruction and information about the `IdleOn - The Idle RPG` game to the general public, and are either used with express permission or believed to be covered by [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) through limited use primarily for commentary, but also at times for news reporting and criticism.

### Derivitive Assets

Information in this guide, website or application, ultimately describe the elements that exist within the `IdleOn - The Idle RPG` game. Most descriptive game terms and images are often derived from game elements like text, images, animations, and videos, covered above.

Because of this, some elements on our website or application may also appear similar to other information references or guides, which are also derived from the same source of truth; the game. 

In the event we use information from another website or application or product, we always do our utmost best to comply with all aspects of the respective Copyright and License requirements from `IdleOn - The Idle RPG`, but also any from the resources we may have used when creating our website or application.

In such a secondary source, and whenever possible, we attempt to trace all information and assets back to the `IdleOn - The Idle RPG` game itself; rather than the secondary source; and use it directly from the Game instead.

### IdleOn MMO wiki

Some information may originate from the [IdleOn MMO Wiki](https://idleon.wiki/) or appear very similar, it being both a compilation of reference information from the IdleOn game but also common sense advice or conclusions about the game.

Content there is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) unless otherwise noted.

Since it is specifically Non-Commercial, when we do refer to information from the wiki, we make every effort to instead trace information back to the game instead, as this license is incompatible with us retaining full copyright rights and relicensing on our own produced assets.

If we must use content directly from the wiki, we only use the minimum required to direct users to view the information in the wiki itself and so this use would fall under fair use.

### Other websites, apps, resources, guides

Some information may originate from other sources or appear very similar, them all being a compilation of reference information from the IdleOn game but also common sense advice or conclusions about the game.

When we do refer to information from other sources, we always make every attempt to comply with their copyright and license.  We also make every effort to instead trace information back to the game instead, that is most compatible with us retaining full copyright and relicensing rights to our own produced content and assets.

If we must use content directly from another source, we only use the minimum required to direct users to view the information in the source itself and so this use would fall under fair use.
