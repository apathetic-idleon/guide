:::caution
If you're a person who has problems controlling their spending or gambling compulsions, the IdleOn game is not for you.
:::

## Purchase Cost

The game does not cost anything to install or create an account. 

You can *start out* and *try the gameplay* without paying anything.

**First Purchase:** If you like what you see, a day or two in, we recommend purchasing the Quality of Life (QoL) `Auto Loot` feature in the main in-game menu for ~ USD$6. It is how the game is **meant to be played** long term.

**Optional Second Purchase:** A few weeks in, if you're still enjoying it, and want a *completely optional* signficiant QoL increase, we recommend purchasing the `Ram` pack which gives *global inventory access* for ~USD$10. If you're okay with waiting, there are alternative mechanics and the `Ram` is available for free much later on in the game.

#### Additional optional spending

Many other *completely optional* packs, speedup purchases, and gambling chance purchases exist in the game. We recommend against purchasing them in the beginning. 

Some of the packs offer exclusive power for real dollar spending. None *unlock* or *enable* new gameplay. You are paying to play faster, reducing the amount of time before the game slows down signficantly.

Once you are later in the game, having unlocked all game mechanics, and things have started to slow down, purchasing optional packs can be a way to speedup gameplay again if you'd like something faster pace at that point, or simply to further support the game's developer.

## Platforms

:::tip
Do not login in-game with *Steam*! *See <a href="#logins">logins section</a>.*
:::

You can play IdleOn on the following platforms, and switch between them at any time:

- [Windows via Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1476970/IdleOn__The_Idle_RPG/)
- [iOS via Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/idleon-idle-mmo/id1636526901) *(phones, tablets)*
- [Android via Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lavaflame.MMO) *(phones, tablets)*
- [SteamDeck via Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1476970/IdleOn__The_Idle_RPG/) *using the touchscreen or mouse peripheral*
- [Browser](https://www.legendsofidleon.com/ytGl5oc/) *any modern fully featured, no game install required*

:::note
Several achievements up to *World 4* only give in-game rewards when playing via Steam (using any login method). It does not matter which platform you start on. The rewards are not exclusive, and do not make a long term difference. Play *where* and *when* you want.
:::

## Logins

:::tip
`Crossplay` is not enabled for *Steam* logins specifically. You can play via Steam, but use any of the other login methods instead. Oneday you may want to crossplay on mobile or tablet.
:::

Login types are:
- Google
- Apple
- Email
- Steam *(only if playing via Steam)*

We recommend using `Google` or `Apple` so that you can enjoy crossplay, avoid having to create and remember a *complex passpharase* for your IdleOn account, and because they provide secure third party authentication.

We **do not** recommend the `Steam` as it has <AsOf date="2025-09-08">crossplay disabled</AsOf>. 

We **do not** recommend the `Email` because of potential weaker passwords and lack of secure third party authentication.

:::note
Some popular third party tools require access to your IdleOn account, especially to help with later stages in the game. You may oneday want to use one. `Email` requires them to temporarily process your *email* and *password*, and if the tool was oneday compromised, could cause security problems for you, especially if you use the same password for anything else. Other login types are more secure and do not have this problem with third party tools.
