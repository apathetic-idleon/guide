You need to know a few things upfront. 

- You cannot rename characters.
- You cannot reorder characters.
- You will create 10+ characters throughout the game.<br /><small>Likely in the first few weeks of gameplay.</small>

## Naming your characters

:::note
Your character names <Stress>must</Stress> be unique to <Stress>all</Stress> characters in IdleOn.
:::

We suggest using a common <Def desc="Letters that come at the beginning of the name">prefix</Def> on all your characters that represents you. For example if your online username is usually `Alex`, start each character name with that.

Since you do not know if a character will change role later in the game, we recommend against putting their purpose in their name.

Since you will need to make many characters all with unique names, we suggest using a <Def desc="Letters that come at the end of the name">suffix</Def> denoting which # the character is in your roster. You can use spaces, dashes, or underscores. A simple `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` works; roman numerals like ` I`, ` II`, ` III`, `IV`; or even `1st`, `2nd`, `3rd`, `4th`.

So in our example above, the first four character names would be:

- `Alex 1`
- `Alex 2`
- `Alex 3`
- `Alex 4`

## Star Sign

All choices are roughly equal, and can be changed early on in the game at any time. Pick any.

## Gender

Gender has no impact on gameplay or appearance, and only changes pronouns in some dialogs.

## Starting Hats

You eventually get bonuses for each new type of item you have collected so far, so try to pick a different hat for each character, which will save you time from farming them later. 

:::tip
To make sure it registers as looted, once you are in-game, drop it (by dragging it from the inventory window to the top of the screen), and pick it back up.
:::

## Classes

You do not pick a class at character creation, but instead early on through in-game quests. As a preview, the main archetypes are `Warrior`, `Archer`, and `Mage`. Later in the game you unlock a support class called `Journeyman`. Even later on, in addition to the base class, you gain multiple specialization classes.

## Unlocking more characters

Characters are unlocked when the total level of all your current characters breaks the denoted threshold. This will happen very quickly, and you will likely have your second character within hours, and all 10+ characters created within a few weeks of playing.
