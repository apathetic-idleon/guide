## Platforms

<Aside type="tip">Do not login in-game with *Steam*! *See <a href="#logins">logins section</a>.*</Aside>

You can play IdleOn on the following platforms, and switch between them at any time:

- [Windows via Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1476970/IdleOn__The_Idle_RPG/)
- [iOS via Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/idleon-idle-mmo/id1636526901) *(phones, tablets)*
- [Android via Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lavaflame.MMO) *(phones, tablets)*
- [SteamDeck via Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1476970/IdleOn__The_Idle_RPG/) *using the touchscreen or mouse peripheral*
- [Browser](https://www.legendsofidleon.com/ytGl5oc/) *any modern fully featured, no game install required*

<Aside type="note">Several achievements up to *World 4* only give in-game rewards when playing via Steam (using any login method). It does not matter which platform you start on. The rewards are not exclusive, and do not make a long term difference. Play *where* and *when* you want.</Aside>

## Logins

<Aside type="tip">`Crossplay` is not enabled for *Steam* logins specifically. You can play via Steam, but use any of the other login methods instead. Oneday you may want to crossplay on mobile or tablet.</Aside>

Login types are:
- Google
- Apple
- Email
- Steam *(only if playing via Steam)*

We recommend using `Google` or `Apple` so that you can enjoy crossplay, avoid having to create and remember a *complex passpharase* for your IdleOn account, and because they provide secure third party authentication.

We **do not** recommend the `Steam` as it has <AsOf date="2025-09-08">crossplay disabled</AsOf>. 

We **do not** recommend the `Email` because of potential weaker passwords and lack of secure third party authentication.

<Aside type="note">Some popular third party tools require access to your IdleOn account, especially to help with later stages in the game. You may oneday want to use one. `Email` requires them to temporarily process your *email* and *password*, and if the tool was oneday compromised, could cause security problems for you, especially if you use the same password for anything else. Other login types are more secure and do not have this problem with third party tools.</Aside>
