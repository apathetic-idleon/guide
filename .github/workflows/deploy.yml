# to create your key:
#   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -f path/to/keyfile -N "" -C "github-actions"
# make sure no passphrase, can't get prompted in github secret

# if you need older rsa method for older servers:
#   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -o -f path/to/keyfile -N "" -C "github-actions"

# on the source repo: add the private key file contents without an extension to ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY secrets
#   repo -> settings -> environments -> github-pages -> Environment secrets -> add ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY secret -> paste in contents
# make sure there is a trailing newline at the end. It will fail otherwise.
# also, if you use environment secret here, you need to use `environment: github-pages` below. Otherwise use a repository secret instead.

# on the destination repo: add the file contents of the .pub file to deploy keys
#   repo -> settings -> Security header -> Deploy keys -> Add deploy key -> check write access

# make sure both files use linux LF characters, not windows ones.
# if you have a copy paste / clipboard utility or some other program it may mangle the contents.

# if you private key does not have `BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY` in header you NEED to convert to PEM (make a backup of your key first):
#   ssh-keygen -p -f path/to/your/key -m pem
